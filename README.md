## Project Description
This repository showcases the work completed during the December 2024 Bug Jam competition, where my team and I worked to test and identify bugs in the *Friendsgiving Jam* app. Our main task was to find and document bugs, write comprehensive test cases, and verify the app's functionality through thorough testing. We also ensured the app's performance and accessibility were up to standard, testing across multiple environments to ensure it worked seamlessly for all users.

## Key Responsibilities  
- **Test Cases (TC_024 - TC_095):** I was responsible for writing and executing test cases to cover a wide range of app features.  
- **Bug Reporting:** I identified critical bugs in the application, created detailed reports with steps to reproduce, and assessed the priority and severity of each issue.  
- **Environment Testing:** Conducted testing across various environments to ensure compatibility and functionality, including performance and accessibility checks.  
- **Performance & Accessibility Testing:** Verified that the app met performance standards and was accessible for all users, ensuring optimal user experience across devices and browsers.
- **Presenting the Project:** Alongside my team, I created and presented our project findings, summarizing the bugs found and the current state of the web application.

## Tools Used  
- **Test Case Documentation:** Google Sheets for organizing test cases and bug reports.  
- **Bug Reporting:** Jira for tracking and managing bugs, including status updates and resolutions.  
- **Testing Environments:** Tested across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) and devices to ensure full functionality.
